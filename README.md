Hey! 
Let's learn together!

This is a 160 days of Data Structures Challenge by GeeksForGeeks, I will be sharing the approach i have used <3
I code using Java because why not? ;)

ARRAYS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day1:
   Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.
   Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Day2:
  Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Day3:
  You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Day4:
  Given an unsorted array arr[]. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by d steps, where d is a positive integer. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.
  Note: Consider the array as circular.

Day5:
  Given an array of integers arr[] representing a permutation, implement the next permutation that rearranges the numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation. If no such permutation exists, 
  rearrange the numbers into the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order). Note - A permutation of an array of integers refers to a specific arrangement of its elements in a sequence or linear order.

Day6:
  You are given an array of integer arr[] where each number represents a vote to a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third of the total votes, If there's not a majority vote, 
  return an empty array. 
  Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing format.
